Above are the interfaces for a school fee management application. You will notice that the payments have a field payId that has a unique index with the studentId. This is because the students every month have to deposit a monthly fee for which a payment document is created. The payId value is a string generated from the date object and has the format "MMYY". So a student depositing a fee for January 2024 then the payId "0124" would be added. The payId indicates for which month of the year the payment was made and the unique index ensure that no duplicated can be added willingly or unwillingly. Below is the schema for the classes


const schema = new Schema<IClass>(
	{
		className: {
			type: Schema.Types.String,
			enum: [
				'Nursery',
				'Prep',
				'1st',
				'2nd',
				'3rd',
				'4th',
				'5th',
				'6th',
				'7th',
				'8th',
				'9th',
				'10th'
			],
			trim: true,

			unique: true,
			required: true
		},
		section: {
			type: [Schema.Types.String],
			required: true
		},
		fee: {
			type: Schema.Types.Number,
			required: true
		},
		subjects: {
			type: [classSubjectSchema],
			required: true
		},
		classTeacher: {
			type: {
				teacherId: {
					type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
					ref: 'Teacher'
				},
				teacherName: {
					type: Schema.Types.String
				}
			}
		}
	},
	{
		timestamps: true,
		versionKey: false
	}
);

All the students are divided into classes from nursery to 10th and further into class sections. Sections for a class can be "A" - "E" where some classes might have all A - E while some might have less.

Now the problem at hand is that we need to be able to query for the students that have their payment history summary attached "Only overview not population". Discuss the most optimal way to query the students with the aim that the students paid status is added for example

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "65e15f87903bc401b2fa4475"
  },
  "name": "Ayesah",
  "gender": "female",
  "dob": {
    "$date": "2020-09-25T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "place_of_birth": "Sialkot",
  "b_form": "3460345425746",
  "father_name": "Amanullah",
  "father_occupation": "Labour",
  "father_cnic": "3460331197481",
  "address": "Haji Pura Sialkot",
  "cast": "Bhatti",
  "religion": "Islam",
  "phone": "03245894250",
  "classId": {
    "$oid": "65cd91a2865b2d275c52231e"
  },
  "className": "Nursery",
  "section": "A",
  "feeType": "Full",
  "tuition_fee": 11,
  "status": {
    "remarks": [
      "acdb"
    ],
    "isSpecialCondition": true
  },
  "admission_date": {
    "$date": "2024-03-01T04:54:31.434Z"
  },
  "createdAt": {
    "$date": "2024-03-01T04:54:31.434Z"
  },
  "updatedAt": {
    "$date": "2024-11-07T13:26:52.910Z"
  },
  "registration_no": "240301-0-02",
  "__v": 0,
  "history": [
    { "0124": true },
	{ "0224" : false }
  ]
}

Now before you attempt to provide a solution you must ask for all relevant context and / or code snippets that you might require in order to generate the correct code. 

Thank you for providing the detailed interfaces and schema. Before suggesting a solution, I need some additional context to ensure I provide the most optimal approach:

1. What is the current MongoDB version being used? This matters because different versions support different aggregation features.

2. How is the payment date being stored in the Payment model? Is it:
   - The actual date of payment, or 
   - The month/year for which the payment is meant (since payId represents MMYY)?

3. For the history array in your example output:
   - Should it show all months from admission_date until current date?
   - Or only months where either a payment exists or is due?
   - What should be the length of history (how many months back)?

4. What's the typical data volume we're dealing with?
   - Approximate number of students
   - Approximate number of payments per student
   - How many months of history need to be maintained

5. Can you share any existing query code you might be using currently to fetch students?

6. Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints we need to consider?

This information will help me suggest the most efficient approach, particularly around:
- Whether to use aggregation or multiple queries
- How to structure the pipeline for optimal performance
- Whether to consider adding additional indexes
- Whether to consider data denormalization strategies

1."mongoose": "^8.3.2", 

A sample payment document is shown below

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "66207751d40edc3877ba4c1d"
  },
  "studentId": {
    "$oid": "65e1781a903bc401b2fa44e4"
  },
  "classId": {
    "$oid": "65cd91a2865b2d275c52231f"
  },
  "className": "Prep",
  "section": "A",
  "amount": 1230,
  "paymentDate": {
    "$date": "2024-04-18T01:28:49.764Z"
  },
  "paymentMethod": "cash",
  "paymentStatus": "success",
  "payId": "0424",
  "paymentType": "Full",
  "createdBy": {
    "$oid": "65cd91a2865b2d275c52231d"
  },
  "__v": 0
}

-All months from admission date till current date should ideally be shown if performance doesnt take a big hit 

- It should display all paid and due month

- Upto 24 months can be shown if data is available

The student strength is 1300 students with ideally every student making at least one payment a month (note that arrears for missed fees and advance fee for future months may also be paid. so for example if a student can make more than one payments a month given that payId are not the same".

- For sake of the query 24 months is a adequate history ,  for a more detailed query a different api can be formulated which is beyond the scope of this task

A sample aggregation could be


export const studentDetailsWithPayments = async (studentId: string) => {
	const result = await StudentModel.aggregate([
		// Match the student by ID
		{ $match: { _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(studentId) } },

		// Lookup to join with payments collection
		{
			$lookup: {
				from: 'payments', // the collection name in the database
				localField: '_id', // field from the student collection
				foreignField: 'studentId', // field from the payments collection
				as: 'feeDocuments' // the array that will hold all the joined documents
			}
		},

		// Unwind the feeDocuments to sort and then regroup
		{
			$unwind: {
				path: '$feeDocuments',
				preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true
			}
		},

		// Sort the payments by payId within each student
		{ $sort: { 'feeDocuments.payId': 1 } },

		// Group back to get all feeDocuments in one array
		{
			$group: {
				_id: '$_id',
				root: { $mergeObjects: '$$ROOT' },
				feeDocuments: { $push: '$feeDocuments' }
			}
		},

		// Project to structure the output document
		{
			$replaceRoot: {
				newRoot: {
					$mergeObjects: ['$root', '$$ROOT']
				}
			}
		},
		{ $project: { root: 0 } } // Remove the temporary 'root' field
	]);

	return result;
};

This should be considered as sample only and not a indictive of preference.

Also note ideally we would group the students by class and further by class section so the heavy lifting is already done by the server.
