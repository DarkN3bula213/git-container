### Changelog and Migration Documentation

#### 1. **Project Overview**

This document provides detailed information regarding the migration from the older `CalendarEvent` model to the new `Event` model. The migration includes structural changes to the schema and validation updates to accommodate new requirements for managing events in your application.

#### 2. **Old Model: `CalendarEvent`**

**Structure:**

- **title**: The title of the event (String, required).
- **description**: A brief description of the event (String, optional).
- **startTime**: The start time of the event (Date, required).
- **endTime**: The end time of the event (Date, required).
- **location**: The location where the event will take place (String, required).
- **attendees**: An array of strings representing the names or emails of the attendees (Array of Strings, optional).

**Schema Definition:**

```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

interface CalendarEvent extends mongoose.Document {
  title: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  description: string;
  location: string;
  attendees: string[];
}

const calendarEventSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: String,
    },
    startTime: {
      type: Date,
      required: true,
    },
    endTime: {
      type: Date,
      required: true,
    },
    location: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    attendees: {
      type: [String],
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
    toJSON: {
      transform: (doc, ret) => {
        delete ret._id;
        delete ret.__v;
      },
    },
  }
);

export default mongoose.model<CalendarEvent>(
  'Events',
  calendarEventSchema,
  'event'
);
```

#### 3. **New Model: `Event`**

**Structure:**

- **title**: The title of the event (String, required, max length 100).
- **description**: This field has been removed to simplify the model.
- **date**: The date of the event (Date, required).
- **startTime**: The start time of the event (String, required, in `HH:mm` format).
- **endTime**: The end time of the event (String, required, in `HH:mm` format).
- **location**: The location of the event (String, optional, max length 255).
- **participants**: Renamed from `attendees` to `participants` (Array of Strings, max length 5).
- **isAllDay**: A new boolean field to indicate if the event spans the entire day (Boolean, defaults to false).

**Schema Definition:**

```typescript
import mongoose, { Document, Schema } from 'mongoose';

interface IEvent extends Document {
  title: string;
  location?: string;
  date: Date;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  isAllDay: boolean;
  participants: string[];
}

const EventSchema: Schema = new Schema(
  {
    title: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 100 },
    location: { type: String, maxlength: 255 },
    date: { type: Date, required: true },
    startTime: { type: String, required: true },
    endTime: { type: String, required: true },
    isAllDay: { type: Boolean, default: false },
    participants: { type: [String], default: [] },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

const Event = mongoose.model<IEvent>('Event', EventSchema);

export default Event;
```

#### 4. **Key Changes and Justifications**

1. **Schema Renaming:**
   - **`attendees` to `participants`**: The term "participants" is more inclusive and aligns better with common event terminology.
  
2. **Field Removals:**
   - **`description`**: Removed to simplify the event structure, reducing redundancy in data management.
  
3. **New Fields:**
   - **`isAllDay`**: Added to differentiate between events that occupy the entire day and those that have specific time slots.
  
4. **Type and Structure Changes:**
   - **`startTime` and `endTime`**: Changed from `Date` to `String` in `HH:mm` format. This decision was made to simplify handling of time, especially for recurring events or events across different time zones.
   - **`date`**: Introduced as a separate field to store the event's date, with `startTime` and `endTime` storing only the time component.
   - **`location`**: Made optional with an increased max length, providing flexibility for more descriptive locations.
   - **`title`**: Introduced a max length of 100 characters to ensure consistency in data storage.

#### 5. **Migration Strategy**

1. **Data Backup:**
   - Before proceeding with the migration, create a backup of your current `CalendarEvent` collection. This ensures that no data is lost during the migration process.
  
2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Write a script that iterates over each document in the `CalendarEvent` collection:
     - **Move `startTime` and `endTime` fields**: Convert these fields from `Date` objects to strings in `HH:mm` format.
     - **Remove `description`**: Drop the `description` field from each document.
     - **Introduce `isAllDay`**: Set this to `false` by default unless you can infer its value from the existing data.
     - **Rename `attendees` to `participants`**: Simply update the field name.
     - **Introduce `date`**: Extract the date component from the existing `startTime` field and store it separately in the new `date` field.

3. **Schema Update:**
   - Replace the existing Mongoose schema with the new `Event` schema.

4. **Database Update:**
   - Run the data transformation script to update all existing documents to the new schema structure.
  
5. **Validation Update:**
   - Replace any existing validation logic with the new Joi validation schema provided in the code above.

6. **Testing:**
   - After migration, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected with the new schema. Verify that no data has been lost or corrupted.

#### 6. **Post-Migration Considerations**

- **API Updates**: Ensure that any API endpoints interacting with the event data are updated to work with the new schema and validation rules.
- **Documentation**: Update any documentation to reflect the changes made during the migration, including API docs, data models, and user guides.

#### 7. **Rollback Plan**

In the unlikely event that the migration causes issues:
- **Restore Backup**: Use the backup taken before migration to restore the `CalendarEvent` collection.
- **Revert Schema**: Revert the Mongoose schema to its original structure.
- **Rollback Data Transformation**: Write a rollback script to reverse the data transformation process if required.

### Conclusion

This migration changes the event data structure to improve flexibility, consistency, and future-proofing. Following the steps outlined in this document will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and schema, with minimal disruption to existing data and application functionality.
